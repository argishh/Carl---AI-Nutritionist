## **Overview**

Carl aims to revolutionize the way we understand our diet. By simply uploading a picture of your daily meal, Carl uses cutting-edge AI technology to analyze its contents and provide detailed information about calories, carbohydrates, fats, fibers, and sugars present in the food. This application is perfect for anyone looking to adapt to a healthier diet or track their nutritional intake more accurately.

## **Features**

- **Image Analysis**: Users can upload images of their meals for analysis.
- **Nutritional Breakdown**: Provides detailed insights into the calories, carbohydrates, fats, fibers, and sugars present in the food.
- **Diet Adaptation**: Assists users in adapting to new diets by providing accurate nutritional information.
- **Health Optimization**: Aids in maintaining optimal health through better dietary choices.

## **Technologies Used**

**Primary Language** - Python

- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework used for building the front-end of the application.
- **Gemini Pro API**: A state-of-the-art AI model used for generating content and analyzing resumes.
- **python-dotenv**: A Python package used for managing environment variables.

## **How it Works**

1. **Upload Food Image**: Upload an image of your meal ( `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` files only )
2. **Analysis**: Upon clicking "`Tell me about the Nutrients in this food`", the app analyses analyzes the image to identify the food items along with its quantity.
3. **Nutritional Insight**: The app displays a detailed breakdown of the nutritional content.
